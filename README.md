This repository contains the code and documents for my COS30018 - Intelligent Systems Project Assessment.
For this assessment I will be testing and improving a machine learning model to predict stock prices using the provide stock_prediction.py code.

This repo contains:
- The stock_prediction.py file in the v0.1 folder, along with other files relevant to development and testing of the stock prediction model, such as the requirements.txt file
- The task instruction PDFs in the Tasks folder
- All weekly reports in the Reports folder

The weekly reports will also be submitted to the project's wiki.
