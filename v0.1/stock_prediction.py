# Build the Model
## TO DO:
# 1) Check if data has been built before. 
# If so, load the saved data
# If not, save the data into a directory
# 2) Change the model to increase accuracy?
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
model = Sequential() # Basic neural network
# See: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential
# for some useful examples

model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(x_train.shape[1], 5)))
# This is our first hidden layer which also spcifies an input layer. 
# That's why we specify the input shape for this layer; 
# i.e. the format of each training example
# The above would be equivalent to the following two lines of code:
# model.add(InputLayer(input_shape=(x_train.shape[1], 1)))
# model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True))
# For som eadvances explanation of return_sequences:
# https://machinelearningmastery.com/return-sequences-and-return-states-for-lstms-in-keras/
# https://www.dlology.com/blog/how-to-use-return_state-or-return_sequences-in-keras/
# As explained there, for a stacked LSTM, you must set return_sequences=True 
# when stacking LSTM layers so that the next LSTM layer has a 
# three-dimensional sequence input. 

# Finally, units specifies the number of nodes in this layer.
# This is one of the parameters you want to play with to see what number
# of units will give you better prediction quality (for your problem)

model.add(Dropout(0.2))
# The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of 
# rate (= 0.2 above) at each step during training time, which helps 
# prevent overfitting (one of the major problems of ML). 

model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True))
# More on Stacked LSTM:
# https://machinelearningmastery.com/stacked-long-short-term-memory-networks/

model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(LSTM(units=50))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))

model.add(Dense(units=1)) 
# Prediction of the next closing value of the stock price

# We compile the model by specify the parameters for the model
# See lecture Week 6 (COS30018)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
# The optimizer and loss are two important parameters when building an 
# ANN model. Choosing a different optimizer/loss can affect the prediction
# quality significantly. You should try other settings to learn; e.g.
    
# optimizer='rmsprop'/'sgd'/'adadelta'/...
# loss='mean_absolute_error'/'huber_loss'/'cosine_similarity'/...

# Now we are going to train this model with our training data 
# (x_train, y_train)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=25, batch_size=32)
# Other parameters to consider: How many rounds(epochs) are we going to 
# train our model? Typically, the more the better, but be careful about
# overfitting!
# What about batch_size? Well, again, please refer to 
# Lecture Week 6 (COS30018): If you update your model for each and every 
# input sample, then there are potentially 2 issues: 1. If you training 
# data is very big (billions of input samples) then it will take VERY long;
# 2. Each and every input can immediately makes changes to your model
# (a souce of overfitting). Thus, we do this in batches: We'll look at
# the aggreated errors/losses from a batch of, say, 32 input samples
# and update our model based on this aggregated loss.

# TO DO:
# Save the model and reload it
# Sometimes, it takes a lot of effort to train your model (again, look at
# a training data with billions of input samples). Thus, after spending so 
# much computing power to train your model, you may want to save it so that
# in the future, when you want to make the prediction, you only need to load
# your pre-trained model and run it on the new input for which the prediction
# need to be made.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Test the model accuracy on existing data
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Load the test data

#test_data = data['test_df']
#PRICE_VALUE = 'adjclose'

# The above bug is the reason for the following line of code
#test_data = test_data[1:]

actual_prices = np.squeeze(scaler.inverse_transform(np.expand_dims(y_test, axis=0)))

#total_dataset = data['df']
#print(data['df'])
#print(data['test_df'])
# total_dataset = total_dataset[PRICE_VALUE]
#model_inputs = total_dataset[len(total_dataset) - len(test_data) - PREDICTION_DAYS:].values
# We need to do the above because to predict the closing price of the fisrt
# PREDICTION_DAYS of the test period [TEST_START, TEST_END], we'll need the 
# data from the training period

#model_inputs = model_inputs.reshape(-1, 1)
# TO DO: Explain the above line

#model_inputs = scaler.transform(model_inputs)
# We again normalize our closing price data to fit them into the range (0,1)
# using the same scaler used above 
# However, there may be a problem: scaler was computed on the basis of
# the Max/Min of the stock price for the period [TRAIN_START, TRAIN_END],
# but there may be a lower/higher price during the test period 
# [TEST_START, TEST_END]. That can lead to out-of-bound values (negative and
# greater than one)
# We'll call this ISSUE #2

# TO DO: Generally, there is a better way to process the data so that we 
# can use part of it for training and the rest for testing. You need to 
# implement such a way

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Make predictions on test data
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#x_test = []
#for x in range(PREDICTION_DAYS, len(model_inputs)):
#    x_test.append(model_inputs[x - PREDICTION_DAYS:x, 0])

#x_test = np.array(x_test)
#x_test = np.reshape(x_test, (x_test.shape[0], x_test.shape[1], 1))
# TO DO: Explain the above 5 lines

predicted_prices = model.predict(x_test)
predicted_prices = scaler.inverse_transform(predicted_prices)
# Clearly, as we transform our data into the normalized range (0,1),
# we now need to reverse this transformation 
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Plot the test predictions
## To do:
# 1) Candle stick charts
# 2) Chart showing High & Lows of the day
# 3) Show chart of next few days (predicted)

#real_data = [model_inputs[len(model_inputs) - PREDICTION_DAYS:, 0]]
#real_data = np.array(real_data)
#real_data = np.reshape(real_data, (real_data.shape[0], real_data.shape[1], 1))
#real_data = y_test

#prediction = model.predict(real_data)
#prediction = scaler.inverse_transform(prediction)
#print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")

# retrieve the last sequence from data
last_sequence = data["last_sequence"][-PREDICTION_DAYS:]
# expand dimension
last_sequence = np.expand_dims(last_sequence, axis=0)
# get the prediction (scaled from 0 to 1)
prediction = model.predict(last_sequence)
# get the price (by inverting the scaling)
predicted_price = scaler.inverse_transform(prediction)[0][0]

print(f"Future price after {1} days is {predicted_price:.2f}$")




# A few concluding remarks here:
# 1. The predictor is quite bad, especially if you look at the next day 
# prediction, it missed the actual price by about 10%-13%
# Can you find the reason?
# 2. The code base at
# https://github.com/x4nth055/pythoncode-tutorials/tree/master/machine-learning/stock-prediction
# gives a much better prediction. Even though on the surface, it didn't seem 
# to be a big difference (both use Stacked LSTM)
# Again, can you explain it?
# A more advanced and quite different technique use CNN to analyse the images
# of the stock price changes to detect some patterns with the trend of
# the stock price:
# https://github.com/jason887/Using-Deep-Learning-Neural-Networks-and-Candlestick-Chart-Representation-to-Predict-Stock-Market
# Can you combine these different techniques for a better prediction??
